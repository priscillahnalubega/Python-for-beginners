Exercise: Bank Account Class
Objective: Create a BankAccount class to represent a user's bank account. It should allow deposits, withdrawals, and provide the account balance.

Step 1: Define the Class
Attributes:

account_holder: The name of the account holder.
balance: The current balance of the account (initialized to zero).
Methods:

deposit(amount): Method to add funds to the account. It should also print the amount deposited and the new balance.
withdraw(amount): Method to subtract funds from the account if sufficient balance exists. It should also print the amount withdrawn and the new balance.
get_balance(): Method to print the current balance.
Step 2: Create and Test the Class
Create an instance of BankAccount for a user.
Perform some deposits and withdrawals.
Check the balance.
Example Code Structure

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_holder):
        self.account_holder = account_holder
        self.balance = 0

#Exercise: Rectangle Class
Objective: Create a Rectangle class that represents a rectangle and can calculate its area and perimeter.

Step 1: Define the Class
Attributes:

length: The length of the rectangle.
width: The width of the rectangle.
Methods:

area(): Method to calculate and return the area of the rectangle.
perimeter(): Method to calculate and return the perimeter of the rectangle.
Optionally, a method to represent the rectangle's details as a string (like __str__).
Step 2: Create and Test the Class
Create an instance of Rectangle with specific length and width.
Calculate and print the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

### Exercise: Movie Theater Seat Booking System

**Objective**: Create a `Theater` class that represents a small movie theater. The theater will have a fixed number of seats, and you should be able to book a seat, check if a seat is available, and cancel a booking.

#### Step 1: Define the Class
1. **Attributes**:
   - `seats`: A list or dictionary to represent the seats in the theater. Each seat can be either "available" or "booked".

2. **Methods**:
   - `book_seat(seat_number)`: Method to book a specific seat if it's available. If the seat is already booked, print a message indicating that the booking is unsuccessful.
   - `cancel_booking(seat_number)`: Method to cancel the booking of a specific seat.
   - `check_availability(seat_number)`: Method to check if a specific seat is available.
   - `get_available_seats()`: Method to return the number of available seats.

#### Step 2: Create and Test the Class
- Create an instance of `Theater` with a certain number of seats.
- Perform some bookings and cancellations.
- Check the availability of specific seats and the total number of available seats.

#### Example Code Structure
```python
class Theater:
    def __init__(self, total_seats):
        # Initialize the seats

    def book_seat(self, seat_number):
        # Add code to book a seat

    def cancel_booking(self, seat_number):
        # Add code to cancel a booking

    def check_availability(self, seat_number):
        # Add code to check if a seat is available

    def get_available_seats(self):
        # Add code to get the number of available seats

# Testing the class
theater = Theater(20)  # A theater with 20 seats
theater.book_seat(5)
theater.cancel_booking(10)
print(f"Available seats: {theater.get_available_seats()}")

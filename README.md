## 2. Basic Fundamentals of Python
## Basics of Python Syntax
The syntax of a language refers to its structure or to the components that go into producing a well-formed program. 
Python's syntax is renowned for its readability and simplicity, making it an excellent language for beginners. In this document, I will cover the fundamental elements of Python syntax that I have learned so far.
### Indentation
```python
if condition:
    # Indented Block of Code
```  
   
- Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
- The use of tabs or spaces (consistent use is important) signifies a block of code</li>

### Variables and Data types
Variables and data types in Python are value pairs that may change at any point  during the execution of the program.

```python
number = 10        # An integer assignment
name = "John Doe"  # A string assignment
height = 5.4       # A float assignment
```
- Variables are assigned with the variable name on the left and the value on the right of the equals sign.
- Python is dynamically typed, so you don't declare the type of a variable.
### Operators
```python
# Arithmetic operators
sum = 7 + 3
difference = 7 - 3

# Assignment operators
x = 10
x += 3

# Comparison operators
if x == 13:
    # Do something
```
- Python includes various types of operators like arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators.
### Control Flow Statements
```python
# If statement
if x < 10:
    print("Less than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("Equal to 10")
else:
    print("Greater than 10")

# While loop
while x < 15:
    print(x)
    x += 1

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
- Control flow statements, like if, elif, else, while, and for, control the execution of code based on conditions.
#### Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name
```
- Functions are defined using the def keyword.
- They can take arguments and return values.
### Classes and Objects
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        return "Hello, " + self.name

person = Person("John")
print(person.greet())
```
- Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and objects.
### Importing Modules
```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
```
- Use the import statement to include the functionality of external modules.
### Exception Handling
```python
try:
    # Code that might cause an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # Code to handle the exception
finally:
    # Code that runs no matter what
````
try, except, finally, and raise are used for handling exceptions.

##    Advanced File and Data Management
### File access modes in Python
1. Read only ('r'): This mode opens a text file for only reading. The file handle is poised at the outset of the file. If the file doesn't exist, an I/O error is raised.
2. Read and write ('r+'): In this mode the file is opened for both reading and writing, with the handled position at the beginning of the file. An I/O error is raised if the file is missing.
3. Writing only ('w'): When a file is opened in this mode its specifically for writing purposes.
4. Write and read ('w+'): similar to 'w', Enables both writing and reading. It truncates and overwrites existing data if the file exists.
5. Append only  ('a'): This mode is meant for writing  and also creating files incase they are absent.The file handle is located at the end of the file, and newly written datais appended after the existing content.The key difference from write mode ('w') is that in append mode, if the file already exists, Python will not truncate (or delete) the existing contents of the file. Instead, it will position the file pointer at the end of the file, so that any new data written to the file will be added after the existing data.
Append mode is ideal when you want to add more text to an existing file without overwriting or losing any of the current content. This is particularly useful in scenarios like:

Logging: If you're writing a log file where you need to continuously add new log entries without deleting the old ones.
Data Accumulation: When you're gathering data over time, such as sensor readings, and you want to keep adding new data points to the same file.

6. Append and read ('a+'):  This mode is both for writing and reading. It opens the file for both operations, creating the file if its necessary, The file handle can be found at the end of the file, and new data can be appended after existing data.


### How files are Loaded into Primary Memory
Computers have two forms of memory, i.e : Primary memory and secondary memory.
Primary memory or RAM (Random Access Memory) loses it contents when the computer is switched off.
Secondary memory refers to any saved file.

In order to handle a text file in python or effect any changes, the file must be loaded into primary memory.
-Python interacts with files in primary memory through 'File Handlers' which serve as conduits which allow python to interact with the file.

### Opening a File 
The open() function: creates a connection between your file on the disk and your program. This allows your program to read from or write to the file. 
The syntax for openning a file is :
```
File object = open (r"File_Name", "Access mode")

```
If the file is not located in the same directory as the Python program file,its complete address should be given in the lieu of the file name. The file should exist  in the same folder as the python program file. 
The letter r is inserted before the file name so that every character in the filename  string is not interpreted as a special character.
If the file is located in the same location, and its address is not being inserted, the r maybe regarded as unnecessary.

```python
#open function to open the file. "Myfile1.txt"
#Same directory in Append mode and store its reference in variable file1
file1 = open("MyFile1.txt", "a")
```
```python
#"MyFile2.txt" in D:\Text in file2
file2 = open(r"D:\Text\MyFile2.txt","w+")
```
### Closing a file
The close() function closes the file. It is used when the file is nolonger crucial or when you want to set the file in another mode.
Closing a file after you're done with it is crucial for several reasons:

1. Resource Management: Open files consume system resources. If too many files are left open, it can exhaust the system's file handles, potentially leading to resource depletion.

2. Data Integrity: Especially when writing to a file, closing it ensures that all data is properly written to disk. If a program terminates without closing a file, there's a risk that the data in the buffer (temporary storage) might not be completely written to the file, leading to data corruption or loss.

3. File Accessibility: In some operating systems, a file that's open in one program might be locked and thus not accessible to other programs. Closing a file when it's no longer needed allows other programs to access it.
```
File_object.close()
#opening and closing a file "MyFile.txt"
#for object name file1
file1 = open("Myfile.txt","a")
file1.close()
```
### The with statement in Python
1. Automatic File Closure: When you use the with statement to open a file, the file is automatically closed when the block of code inside the with statement is exited, even if an error occurs. This ensures that the file is properly closed without explicitly calling the close() method.

2. Exception Handling: The with statement also handles any exceptions that might occur within the block, making your code cleaner and more readable.

The syntax for using the with statement to open a file looks like this:
```
with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read from the file or perform file operations

```
After the block of code under the with statement is executed, the file is automatically closed.

### The with statement use in real-world programming scenarios, especially when dealing with multiple file operations.
1. Data Processing: When you're reading from or writing to data files (like CSV, JSON, or plain text files) for processing. The with statement ensures that your file is closed after the operations, which is crucial to prevent data corruption or loss.

2. Batch Processing: In scenarios where you're processing multiple files in a batch (e.g., reading multiple data files in a directory), the with statement helps in efficiently managing each file's opening and closing, thus conserving system resources.

3. Error Handling: In data processing, it's common to encounter errors (like malformed data). The with statement ensures that files are closed properly, even if an error occurs, which is important for maintaining the integrity of both the program and the data.

4. Working with Databases or External Resources: Similarly, when interacting with databases or reading from external resources like APIs, the with statement can be used to ensure that connections are closed properly after the operations are completed.

### Scenario: Reading and Processing Text from a File
Suppose you have a text file named data.txt that contains several lines of information, and you need to read each line, perform some processing (like parsing or searching for specific keywords), and maybe store the results in a list.

Here's how you might approach this with the with statement:

Open the File for Reading: You would use the with statement to open your file in read mode ('r'). This ensures the file is properly closed after you're done reading it.

Read Each Line: Inside the with block, you would iterate over each line in the file, processing it as required.

Process the Data: As you read each line, you can perform any necessary processing – such as parsing data, filtering based on conditions, or extracting specific information.

Store Results: If needed, you can store the processed results in a list or any other data structure for further use.

Here's a simplified version of how the code might look:

```
processed_data = []

with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        # Process each line
        processed_line = line.strip()  # Example: stripping whitespace
        processed_data.append(processed_line)

# At this point, 'data.txt' is automatically closed
# 'processed_data' now contains the processed lines
```
In this example, the with statement ensures that data.txt is automatically closed after we're done reading and processing it, even if an error occurs during the process.

To modify the approach for writing processed data to a new file, we need to make a few adjustments to the code. 
Open Two Files: You will open the file you are reading from (say, 'data.txt') and the file you are writing to (let's call it 'output.txt').

Process and Write: As you read each line from 'data.txt', you'll process it and then write the processed line to 'output.txt'.

Here's an example of how you might structure this:
```
with open('data.txt', 'r') as read_file:
    with open('output.txt', 'w') as write_file:
        for line in read_file:
            processed_line = line.strip()  # Process the line
            write_file.write(processed_line + '\n')  # Write to the output file

```
In this code:

with open('data.txt', 'r') as read_file opens 'data.txt' for reading.
with open('output.txt', 'w') as write_file opens 'output.txt' for writing. If 'output.txt' doesn't exist, it will be created; if it does exist, its content will be overwritten.
The for loop reads each line from 'data.txt', processes it, and then writes the processed line to 'output.txt'. The '\n' is added to ensure each line is written on a new line in 'output.txt'.

### Understanding XML and JSON in python
Understanding how to work with XML and JSON in Python is a valuable skill, as these are common formats for data exchange and configuration. Let's break down the basics for each:

### JSON in Python:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

- **Reading JSON**: Python has a built-in module called `json` for handling JSON data. To read JSON from a file, you can use `json.load()`.

  ```python
  import json

  with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
      data = json.load(file)
  ```

- **Writing JSON**: To write JSON to a file, use `json.dump()`.

  ```python
  import json

  data = {'key': 'value'}  # Example dictionary
  with open('output.json', 'w') as file:
      json.dump(data, file)
  ```

### XML in Python:

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

- **Reading XML**: Python has several libraries for working with XML, such as `xml.etree.ElementTree`. To read and parse XML, you can use this library.

  ```python
  import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

  tree = ET.parse('data.xml')
  root = tree.getroot()
  ```

  You can then iterate through the XML tree, accessing elements and attributes.

- **Writing XML**: To write XML data, you can use the same `xml.etree.ElementTree` library.

  ```python
  import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

  root = ET.Element("root")
  child = ET.SubElement(root, "child")
  child.text = "This is a test"

  tree = ET.ElementTree(root)
  tree.write("output.xml")
  ```

### Practice Exercises:

To get comfortable with JSON and XML in Python, you can try the following exercises:

1. **JSON Parsing Exercise**:
   - Create a JSON file with some sample data (like a list of users, each with attributes like name, age, and email).
   - Write a Python script to read this JSON file and print out each user's information.

2. **XML Parsing Exercise**:
   - Create a simple XML file, perhaps representing a bookstore with a list of books, each with a title, author, and price.
   - Write a Python script to parse this XML and print out the details of each book.

3. **Data Conversion Exercise**:
   - Convert JSON data to XML and vice versa. For instance, read data from a JSON file, convert it into an XML format, and write it to a new XML file.

## Understanding Advanced Object Oriented Programming
OOP is a style in python and can be implemented by use of classes and objects.

### Classes and Objects in Python:

1. **Classes**: A class in Python is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class can have.

2. **Objects**: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.

#### Defining a Class:
To define a class in Python, you use the `class` keyword. Here's a simple example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"
```

- `__init__` is a special method called a constructor. It's called when an object is created from a class and allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.

#### Creating an Object:
To create an object, you call the class as if it were a function, passing the arguments that the `__init__` method expects.

```python
my_dog = Dog("Rex", "Golden Retriever")
```

- `my_dog` is an instance of the `Dog` class, with `name` as "Rex" and `breed` as "Golden Retriever".

#### Using Object Methods and Attributes:
You can access attributes and call methods on objects using dot notation.

```python
print(my_dog.name)       # Accessing attribute
print(my_dog.bark())     # Calling method
```
### Exercise: Bank Account Class
Objective: Create a BankAccount class to represent a user's bank account. It should allow deposits, withdrawals, and provide the account balance.

Step 1: Define the Class
Attributes:

account_holder: The name of the account holder.
balance: The current balance of the account (initialized to zero).
Methods:

deposit(amount): Method to add funds to the account. It should also print the amount deposited and the new balance.
withdraw(amount): Method to subtract funds from the account if sufficient balance exists. It should also print the amount withdrawn and the new balance.
get_balance(): Method to print the current balance.
Step 2: Create and Test the Class
Create an instance of BankAccount for a user.
Perform some deposits and withdrawals.
Check the balance.
Example Code Structure
```
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_holder):
        self.account_holder = account_holder
        self.balance = 0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        # Add code for deposit

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        # Add code for withdrawal

    def get_balance(self):
        # Add code to display balance
```

# Testing the class
account = BankAccount("Alice")
account.deposit(100)
account.withdraw(50)
account.get_balance()



### Inheritance in Python

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. This is useful for creating a new class with some additions or changes to the behavior of the original class.

#### Basic Concepts:

1. **Parent Class (Base Class)**: The class being inherited from.
2. **Child Class (Derived Class)**: The class that inherits from another class.

#### Key Features:

- **Reuse Code**: Avoid duplication by inheriting common functionality from a parent class.
- **Extend Functionality**: Add or override methods in the child class.
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding allows child classes to implement parent class methods differently.

#### Example:

Let's say we have a `Vehicle` class (as a parent class) and we want to create a `Car` class that inherits from it (as a child class).

```python
# Parent Class
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        return f"Vehicle: {self.make} {self.model}"

# Child Class
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, model, horsepower):
        super().__init__(make, model)
        self.horsepower = horsepower

    def display_car_info(self):
        return f"{self.display_info()}, Horsepower: {self.horsepower}"
```

In this example:
- `Car` inherits from `Vehicle`.
- `Car` extends `Vehicle` by adding a new attribute (`horsepower`) and a new method (`display_car_info`).
- `super().__init__(make, model)` is used to call the constructor of the parent class.

### Small Project Idea

Let's consider a small project where we can use classes, objects, and inheritance. How about a simple system to manage a library? We can have a base class representing `Books`, and derived classes for different genres like `Fiction`, `NonFiction`, etc., each with some specific attributes or methods.


### Polymorphism in Python

Polymorphism is a key concept in OOP that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. The word "polymorphism" comes from Greek words meaning "many forms". It refers to the ability of different objects to respond in their own way to the same method call.

#### Key Features of Polymorphism:

1. **Method Overriding**: This is where a method in a child class has the same name and parameters as a method in the parent class. The child's method overrides the parent's method when called on an instance of the child class.

2. **Duck Typing**: This is a Python-specific form of polymorphism where an object's suitability for a task is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of object itself.

#### Example of Polymorphism with Method Overriding:



```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.isbn = isbn

    def display_info(self):
        return f"Book: {self.title} by {self.author}"

class Fiction(Book):
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn, genre):
        super().__init__(title, author, isbn)
        self.genre = genre

    def display_info(self):
        return f"{super().display_info()}, Genre: {self.genre}"

class NonFiction(Book):
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn, subject):
        super().__init__(title, author, isbn)
        self.subject = subject

    def display_info(self):
        return f"{super().display_info()}, Subject: {self.subject}"

# Polymorphism in action
books = [Fiction("1984", "George Orwell", "123456789", "Dystopian"),
         NonFiction("A Brief History of Time", "Stephen Hawking", "987654321", "Science")]

for book in books:
    print(book.display_info())
```

In this example:
- Each subclass of `Book` has its own implementation of `display_info`.
- Even though each object in the `books` list is treated as a `Book`, calling `display_info` on them invokes the overridden method specific to their actual class (`Fiction` or `NonFiction`).

This demonstrates polymorphism where the same method call (`display_info`) behaves differently depending on the object it's called on.


### Encapsulation in Python

Encapsulation is the practice of restricting access to certain parts of an object, such as attributes and methods, thus preventing data from being modified by accident. In Python, encapsulation is achieved using private and protected members.

#### Key Features of Encapsulation:

1. **Private Members**: In Python, private members (variables and methods) are denoted by prefixing the name with double underscores `__`. These members can only be accessed within the class and are not visible to derived classes or outside the class.

2. **Protected Members**: Protected members are denoted by a single underscore `_`. They are not strictly private but are intended to be used as an indication that they should not be accessed unless inside a subclass.

#### Example of Encapsulation:

Let's add some encapsulation to our `Book` class by making `isbn` a private member and adding a method to access it safely.

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.__isbn = isbn  # Private member

    def display_info(self):
        return f"Book: {self.title} by {self.author}"

    def get_isbn(self):  # Method to safely access private member
        return self.__isbn

# Testing encapsulation
book = Book("1984", "George Orwell", "123456789")
print(book.display_info())
print(book.get_isbn())  # Accessing ISBN through a method
```

In this example, `__isbn` is a private member of the `Book` class. It cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, the `get_isbn` method provides controlled access to it.

This practice of encapsulation ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside. It allows the internal state of the object to be changed without affecting the ways that external code interacts with it.



### Composition in Python

Composition is a design principle where a class is made up of one or more objects from other classes, allowing for more complex structures. It's often used as an alternative to inheritance for building flexible and maintainable code, especially when one class needs to include functionalities of other classes.

#### Key Features of Composition:

1. **Building Complex Objects**: Composition allows a class to contain objects of different types, providing more flexibility in designing complex systems.

2. **Code Reusability**: By using objects from other classes, you can reuse existing code, enhancing maintainability and reducing redundancy.

3. **Loose Coupling**: Composition leads to loosely coupled systems where classes and objects are independent, making the system easier to manage.

#### Example of Composition:

Let's extend our library management system to include a `Library` class that is composed of various `LibraryItem` instances (like `Book`, `Magazine`, etc.).

```python
class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []  # List to store library items

    def add_item(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def display_all_items(self):
        for item in self.items:
            print(item.display_info())

# Assuming Book and Magazine classes are already defined

# Creating a library and adding items
library = Library()
library.add_item(Book("1984", "George Orwell"))
library.add_item(Magazine("Nature", "123"))

# Displaying all items in the library
library.display_all_items()
```

In this example:
- The `Library` class is composed of a list of `LibraryItem` objects.
- `Library` has methods to add items and display information about all items, leveraging the functionality of the `Book` and `Magazine` classes without inheriting from them.

Composition here provides a flexible way to manage different types of library items, each with its unique characteristics, under a unified library system.



### Magic Methods in Python

Magic methods, also known as dunder (double underscore) methods, are special methods that begin and end with double underscores (`__`). They allow you to define how objects of your classes behave with built-in functions and operators. Magic methods enable you to emulate the behavior of built-in types or implement functionality that's not directly accessible to your class objects.

#### Key Magic Methods:

1. **`__init__(self, ...)`: Constructor for initializing a new object.
2. **`__str__(self)`: Called by the `str(object)` built-in function and by the `print` function to compute the “informal” string representation of an object.
3. **`__repr__(self)`: Called by the `repr(object)` built-in function to compute the “official” string representation of an object.
4. **`__len__(self)`: Implements the built-in function `len()`.
5. **`__add__(self, other)`, `__sub__(self, other)`, etc.: Allow objects of your class to be used with arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, etc.

#### Example of Magic Methods:

Let's add a `__str__` method to the `Book` class in our library management system to define how books are represented as strings.

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Book: {self.title} by {self.author}"

# Creating a book instance
book = Book("1984", "George Orwell")

# Using the __str__ magic method
print(book)  # "Book: 1984 by George Orwell"
```

In this example, the `__str__` method provides a human-readable representation of the `Book` object, which is used when you print a `Book` instance.

.

### Decorators in Python

A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as its argument, and returns yet another function. Decorators can be used to extend or alter the behavior of the wrapped function or method.

#### Key Features of Decorators:

1. **Enhancing Functionality**: Decorators can add functionality to existing functions or methods. They are applied using the `@decorator_name` syntax above a function definition.

2. **Code Reusability**: Since decorators are functions, they can be reused. This is particularly useful in large applications where certain behaviors (like logging or access control) need to be consistently applied across many functions.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Decorators help in keeping the code clean by separating the core functionality from the auxiliary functionality.

#### Example of a Simple Decorator:

Let's create a simple decorator that prints a message before and after the execution of a function.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

In this example, `my_decorator` is a decorator that takes a function `func` as an argument. It defines a nested function `wrapper` that prints messages before and after calling `func`. When we apply `@my_decorator` to `say_hello`, it effectively replaces `say_hello` with the `wrapper` function.

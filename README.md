## 2. Basic Fundamentals of Python
## Basics of Python Syntax
The syntax of a language refers to its structure or to the components that go into producing a well-formed program. 
Python's syntax is renowned for its readability and simplicity, making it an excellent language for beginners. In this document, I will cover the fundamental elements of Python syntax that I have learned so far.
### Indentation
```python
if condition:
    # Indented Block of Code
```  
   
- Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
- The use of tabs or spaces (consistent use is important) signifies a block of code</li>

### Variables and Data types
Variables and data types in Python are value pairs that may change at any point  during the execution of the program.

```python
number = 10        # An integer assignment
name = "John Doe"  # A string assignment
height = 5.4       # A float assignment
```
- Variables are assigned with the variable name on the left and the value on the right of the equals sign.
- Python is dynamically typed, so you don't declare the type of a variable.
### Operators
```python
# Arithmetic operators
sum = 7 + 3
difference = 7 - 3

# Assignment operators
x = 10
x += 3

# Comparison operators
if x == 13:
    # Do something
```
- Python includes various types of operators like arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators.
### Control Flow Statements
```python
# If statement
if x < 10:
    print("Less than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("Equal to 10")
else:
    print("Greater than 10")

# While loop
while x < 15:
    print(x)
    x += 1

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
- Control flow statements, like if, elif, else, while, and for, control the execution of code based on conditions.
#### Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name
```
- Functions are defined using the def keyword.
- They can take arguments and return values.
### Classes and Objects
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        return "Hello, " + self.name

person = Person("John")
print(person.greet())
```
- Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and objects.
### Importing Modules
```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
```
- Use the import statement to include the functionality of external modules.
### Exception Handling
```python
try:
    # Code that might cause an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # Code to handle the exception
finally:
    # Code that runs no matter what
````
try, except, finally, and raise are used for handling exceptions.

##    Advanced File and Data Management
### File access modes in Python
1. Read only ('r'): This mode opens a text file for only reading. The file handle is poised at the outset of the file. If the file doesn't exist, an I/O error is raised.
2. Read and write ('r+'): In this mode the file is opened for both reading and writing, with the handled position at the beginning of the file. An I/O error is raised if the file is missing.
3. Writing only ('w'): When a file is opened in this mode its specifically for writing purposes.
4. Write and read ('w+'): similar to 'w', Enables both writing and reading. It truncates and overwrites existing data if the file exists.
5. Append only  ('a'): This mode is meant for writing  and also creating files incase they are absent.The file handle is located at the end of the file, and newly written datais appended after the existing content.The key difference from write mode ('w') is that in append mode, if the file already exists, Python will not truncate (or delete) the existing contents of the file. Instead, it will position the file pointer at the end of the file, so that any new data written to the file will be added after the existing data.
Append mode is ideal when you want to add more text to an existing file without overwriting or losing any of the current content. This is particularly useful in scenarios like:

Logging: If you're writing a log file where you need to continuously add new log entries without deleting the old ones.
Data Accumulation: When you're gathering data over time, such as sensor readings, and you want to keep adding new data points to the same file.

6. Append and read ('a+'):  This mode is both for writing and reading. It opens the file for both operations, creating the file if its necessary, The file handle can be found at the end of the file, and new data can be appended after existing data.


### How files are Loaded into Primary Memory
Computers have two forms of memory, i.e : Primary memory and secondary memory.
Primary memory or RAM (Random Access Memory) loses it contents when the computer is switched off.
Secondary memory refers to any saved file.

In order to handle a text file in python or effect any changes, the file must be loaded into primary memory.
-Python interacts with files in primary memory through 'File Handlers' which serve as conduits which allow python to interact with the file.

### Opening a File 
The open() function: creates a connection between your file on the disk and your program. This allows your program to read from or write to the file. 
The syntax for openning a file is :
```
File object = open (r"File_Name", "Access mode")

```
If the file is not located in the same directory as the Python program file,its complete address should be given in the lieu of the file name. The file should exist  in the same folder as the python program file. 
The letter r is inserted before the file name so that every character in the filename  string is not interpreted as a special character.
If the file is located in the same location, and its address is not being inserted, the r maybe regarded as unnecessary.

```python
#open function to open the file. "Myfile1.txt"
#Same directory in Append mode and store its reference in variable file1
file1 = open("MyFile1.txt", "a")
```
```python
#"MyFile2.txt" in D:\Text in file2
file2 = open(r"D:\Text\MyFile2.txt","w+")
```
### Closing a file
The close() function closes the file. It is used when the file is nolonger crucial or when you want to set the file in another mode.
Closing a file after you're done with it is crucial for several reasons:

1. Resource Management: Open files consume system resources. If too many files are left open, it can exhaust the system's file handles, potentially leading to resource depletion.

2. Data Integrity: Especially when writing to a file, closing it ensures that all data is properly written to disk. If a program terminates without closing a file, there's a risk that the data in the buffer (temporary storage) might not be completely written to the file, leading to data corruption or loss.

3. File Accessibility: In some operating systems, a file that's open in one program might be locked and thus not accessible to other programs. Closing a file when it's no longer needed allows other programs to access it.
```
File_object.close()
#opening and closing a file "MyFile.txt"
#for object name file1
file1 = open("Myfile.txt","a")
file1.close()
```
### The with statement in Python
1. Automatic File Closure: When you use the with statement to open a file, the file is automatically closed when the block of code inside the with statement is exited, even if an error occurs. This ensures that the file is properly closed without explicitly calling the close() method.

2. Exception Handling: The with statement also handles any exceptions that might occur within the block, making your code cleaner and more readable.

The syntax for using the with statement to open a file looks like this:
```
with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read from the file or perform file operations

```
After the block of code under the with statement is executed, the file is automatically closed.

### The with statement use in real-world programming scenarios, especially when dealing with multiple file operations.
1. Data Processing: When you're reading from or writing to data files (like CSV, JSON, or plain text files) for processing. The with statement ensures that your file is closed after the operations, which is crucial to prevent data corruption or loss.

2. Batch Processing: In scenarios where you're processing multiple files in a batch (e.g., reading multiple data files in a directory), the with statement helps in efficiently managing each file's opening and closing, thus conserving system resources.

3. Error Handling: In data processing, it's common to encounter errors (like malformed data). The with statement ensures that files are closed properly, even if an error occurs, which is important for maintaining the integrity of both the program and the data.

4. Working with Databases or External Resources: Similarly, when interacting with databases or reading from external resources like APIs, the with statement can be used to ensure that connections are closed properly after the operations are completed.

### Scenario: Reading and Processing Text from a File
Suppose you have a text file named data.txt that contains several lines of information, and you need to read each line, perform some processing (like parsing or searching for specific keywords), and maybe store the results in a list.

Here's how you might approach this with the with statement:

Open the File for Reading: You would use the with statement to open your file in read mode ('r'). This ensures the file is properly closed after you're done reading it.

Read Each Line: Inside the with block, you would iterate over each line in the file, processing it as required.

Process the Data: As you read each line, you can perform any necessary processing – such as parsing data, filtering based on conditions, or extracting specific information.

Store Results: If needed, you can store the processed results in a list or any other data structure for further use.

Here's a simplified version of how the code might look:

```
processed_data = []

with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        # Process each line
        processed_line = line.strip()  # Example: stripping whitespace
        processed_data.append(processed_line)

# At this point, 'data.txt' is automatically closed
# 'processed_data' now contains the processed lines
```
In this example, the with statement ensures that data.txt is automatically closed after we're done reading and processing it, even if an error occurs during the process.

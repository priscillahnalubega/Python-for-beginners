- Use in Interactive Scripting

### Industry Use-Cases

Python finds its applications in:

- Data Analysis
- Scientific and Mathematical Calculations
- Game Development
- Web Development
- Financial Transactions
- General and Application-Specific Scripting
- Automation and Administrative Management
- Computer Graphics
- Cartography and Geography (using GIS)
- Security System Analysis

## 2. Basic Fundamentals of Python
## Basics of Python Syntax
The syntax of a language refers to its structure or to the components that go into producing a well-formed program. 
Python's syntax is renowned for its readability and simplicity, making it an excellent language for beginners. In this document, I will cover the fundamental elements of Python syntax that I have learned so far.
### Indentation
'''
if condition:
    # Indented Block of Code
'''   
   
-Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
-The use of tabs or spaces (consistent use is important) signifies a block of code</li>

### Variables and Data types
'''
number = 10        # An integer assignment
name = "John Doe"  # A string assignment
'''

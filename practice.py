Exercise: Bank Account Class
Objective: Create a BankAccount class to represent a user's bank account. It should allow deposits, withdrawals, and provide the account balance.

Step 1: Define the Class
Attributes:

account_holder: The name of the account holder.
balance: The current balance of the account (initialized to zero).
Methods:

deposit(amount): Method to add funds to the account. It should also print the amount deposited and the new balance.
withdraw(amount): Method to subtract funds from the account if sufficient balance exists. It should also print the amount withdrawn and the new balance.
get_balance(): Method to print the current balance.
Step 2: Create and Test the Class
Create an instance of BankAccount for a user.
Perform some deposits and withdrawals.
Check the balance.
Example Code Structure
python
Copy code
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_holder):
        self.account_holder = account_holder
        self.balance = 0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        # Add code for deposit

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        # Add code for withdrawal

    def get_balance(self):
        # Add code to display balance

# Testing the class
account = BankAccount("Alice")
account.deposit(100)
account.withdraw(50)
account.get_balance()
